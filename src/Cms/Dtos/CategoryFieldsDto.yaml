# Category Fields DTO (Reference Example)
#
# This is a reusable DTO demonstrating the composition feature.
# It defines common category fields that could be referenced by other DTOs.
#
# NOTE: Currently NOT used via composition in CreateCategoryDto/UpdateCategoryDto because
# the RequestMapper doesn't yet support mapping flat POST data to nested DTO properties.
#
# Future Enhancement: Once RequestMapper supports nested mapping, category DTOs could
# reference this DTO via composition to eliminate duplicate field definitions.
