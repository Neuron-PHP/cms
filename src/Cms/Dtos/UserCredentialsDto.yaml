# User Credentials DTO (Reference Example)
#
# This is a reusable DTO demonstrating the composition feature.
# It defines common user authentication fields that could be referenced by other DTOs.
#
# NOTE: Currently NOT used via composition in CreateUserDto/RegisterUserDto because
# the RequestMapper doesn't yet support mapping flat POST data to nested DTO properties.
# When forms submit flat fields (username, email, password), they must map directly to
# top-level DTO properties for RequestMapper compatibility.
#
# Future Enhancement: Once RequestMapper supports nested mapping, DTOs like RegisterUserDto
# could reference this DTO via composition:
#   credentials:
#     type: dto
#     ref: 'UserCredentialsDto.yaml'
#
# This would eliminate duplicate field definitions across user-related DTOs.
