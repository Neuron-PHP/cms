# Register User DTO
# Note: This DTO uses flat structure instead of composition (referencing UserCredentialsDto)
# because the RequestMapper doesn't yet support mapping flat POST data to nested DTO properties.
# HTML forms submit flat fields (username, email, password) which must map directly to
# top-level DTO properties for RequestMapper compatibility.
