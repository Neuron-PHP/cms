# Email Template Customization
#
# Templates are located in: resources/views/emails/
#
# Available templates:
# - welcome.php - Welcome email sent to new users
#
# To customize, edit the template files directly. They use standard PHP
# templating with variables like $Username, $SiteName, $SiteUrl.
#
# Example customization in welcome.php:
# - Change colors in the <style> section
# - Modify greeting text
# - Update call-to-action button text
# - Add your logo (use absolute URL for images)
# - Customize footer text
