# Neuron CMS Routing Configuration
# This file configures URL rewrites and controller scanning for the CMS

# URL Rewrites
# Transparent URL rewriting (no HTTP redirect) applied before route matching
# By default, the root path (/) is rewritten to /blog
rewrites:
  '/': '/blog'

# Controller Paths
# Directories to scan for controller classes with route attributes
# Order matters: controllers listed first take precedence for duplicate routes
controller_paths:
  # CMS controllers - provides admin panel, blog, auth, etc.
  - path: 'vendor/neuron-php/cms/src/Cms/Controllers'
    namespace: 'Neuron\Cms\Controllers'

# To customize the homepage:
# 1. Create your own controller with a route for the desired path (e.g., /home)
# 2. Update the rewrite above to point '/' to your path
# 3. Add your application controllers before CMS controllers in controller_paths

# Example: Custom homepage
# rewrites:
#   '/': '/home'  # Route to custom homepage
#
# controller_paths:
#   - path: 'app/Controllers'
#     namespace: 'App\Controllers'
#   - path: 'vendor/neuron-php/cms/src/Cms/Controllers'
#     namespace: 'Neuron\Cms\Controllers'
