# Testing Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.testing and fill in your actual credentials
# .env.testing is git-ignored and will not be committed

# Cloudinary Integration Testing (optional)
#
# NOTE: You can also configure Cloudinary during CMS installation by running:
#   php neuron cms:install
#
# This .env.testing file is ONLY needed if you want to run integration tests
# with different credentials than your production config/neuron.yaml
#
# To run Cloudinary integration tests, set your real credentials here:
# Get your CLOUDINARY_URL from: https://console.cloudinary.com/
#CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME

# Or set individual credentials:
#CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
#CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
#CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
#CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=test-folder

# Note: Without these credentials, the 3 Cloudinary integration tests will be skipped
